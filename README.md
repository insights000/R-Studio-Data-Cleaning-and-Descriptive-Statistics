**Assignment 3 on Level 3 Data Technician Bootcamp** 

****Task: ** The task set involves cleaning the data given to us in relation to Hollywoodâ€™s Greatest Stories on a R file, visualising data on an R file and the importing into Power BI once the cleaned data has been exported thus creating a dashboard to show the following visualisations**

Step 1- Load the data and file paths and view data

**-as seen in images used df -< na.omit(df) to achieve**

Use ggplot(df1, aes(x=Lead.Studio, y=Rotten.Tomatoes..)) + geom_point()+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 110))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
to show a scatterplot

 
As seen in the image the code resulted in a scatterplot of Rotten Tomato ratings against studio
